# uTime-Legacy
uTime for macOS 10.14

This version of uTime is no longer updated but remains live on the App Store to those who have macOS Mojave so they cannot install the newer catalyst version.

This was my first dive into a native macOS Application in 2015-2016 written in Objective-C. The application could sync settings and timers with the uTime for iOS Counterpart.
